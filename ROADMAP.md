# Roadmap

What is still open. Everything here is optional: nothing blocks a release.
Each item says what is left and what would prove it done. Finished work is
in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), the numbers behind it in
[docs/dev/measured-facts.md](docs/dev/measured-facts.md).

## Optional: needs a person at the machine

- **`FocusedWindow` in the real session.** Measured in a nested shell; the
  real session loads the extension at the next login. Done when
  `pcbridge doctor` reports the current extension and a `computer_batch`
  with a click succeeds while a window AT-SPI cannot see (a native Wayland
  game) is in front.
- **OCR on this machine.** `find_text` / `wait_for_text` need
  `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr` (plus `tesseract-ocr-tur` for Turkish).
  Measure: finding and clicking a known word in `gnome-text-editor`, a game
  menu entry, and the time to read a full monitor.
- **Cursor overlay with a physical mouse.** Off by default (flag file
  `~/.local/state/pcbridge/gorunur-imlec`); measured only in a nested shell.
  Done when clicking and scrolling with the physical mouse stay normal for a
  working session with it on.

## Optional: engineering

- **`is_open()` does not see the screen lock.** When the screen locks,
  Mutter closes the screen share but the Python side still reports it open.
  Access is not affected (the gate answers `SCREEN_LOCKED`, and expiry
  cleanup no longer trusts the flag); only the "screen share open" line of
  `desktop_unlock` and the capability report can be wrong while locked. The
  fix asks the native helper for its session state (a `capture.session_state`
  protocol method), and needs a real lock and unlock to verify.
- **Retire the legacy Python desktop backends.** The native helper is the
  default for capture, input and accessibility; the Python paths remain as
  the fallback when no helper is packaged. Retiring them needs the helper on
  every supported platform build and a release with the fallback unused.
- **The pixel-area cap and the Anthropic API.** Whether the API itself
  shrinks a 1536x864 picture (about 1.33 MP) was not measured. If it does,
  `shot=` coordinates carry a small systematic error on the right edge, and
  the default cap should drop to what the API keeps as is.
- **A repeat-click counter across calls.** The third-click stop works within
  one sequence; an agent looping over separate `ui_click` calls is not
  caught (see [docs/dev/desktop-rules.md](docs/dev/desktop-rules.md)).
- **lintian in CI** for the `.deb`.
- **A graphical control panel.** A proposal (Tauri + React) for status,
  grant and jobs in one window; nobody has started it.

## Decided and closed

- Windows and macOS backends were dropped (2026-09-20); the project targets
  Linux desktops on Wayland.
- An XDG-portal capture backend for GNOME was dropped (2026-09-20): it
  flashes and asks for consent. This still holds on GNOME.
- "GNOME only" (2026-09-20) was reopened on 2026-09-23: KDE Plasma 6 on
  Wayland and Arch Linux are being added.
- `JARVIS.md`, a proposal to grow pcbridge into a personal assistant, is not
  documentation and was removed in 2.0; git history keeps it.
